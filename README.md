## Usage

Once you have Uptime Monitor installed, you can start creating endpoint checks. The basic command to create a check is:

```bash
uptime-monitor create <endpoint-url>
```

Replace `<endpoint-url>` with the URL of the service you want to monitor.

### Example

```bash
uptime-monitor create https://example.com
```

This command will create a new endpoint check for `https://example.com`.

## Configuration

You can configure Uptime Monitor to suit your needs. The configuration file is located at `~/.uptime-monitor/config.json`. Here’s a sample configuration:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "interval": 5,
      "timeout": 2
    }
  ],
  "alerts": {
    "opsgenie": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_OPSGENIE_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **checks**: An array of objects, each representing an endpoint check.
  - **url**: The URL to monitor.
  - **interval**: How often to check the endpoint (in minutes).
  - **timeout**: How long to wait for a response (in seconds).
  
- **alerts**: Configuration for alerts.
  - **opsgenie**: Object containing your OpsGenie API key.

## Alerts

Uptime Monitor supports integration with OpsGenie for alerts. To set up alerts:

1. Obtain your OpsGenie API key from your OpsGenie account.
2. Add it to your configuration file as shown in the previous section.

Once configured, Uptime Monitor will send alerts to OpsGenie whenever a check fails.
